This application uses Tone.js and allows user to play tones from the range (C3 to F6) using the mouse or keyboard. The application can listen to notes played by the users when the "Listen for Note" button is pressed. After the user stops the listening process, the application then generates music based on the initial notes played. The generator emphasizes on the initial notes played, their durations, and their intervals between notes. Users can press the "Restart Listener" to start over again with a different set of notes.
